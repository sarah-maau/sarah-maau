## Hi there 👋

🌱 I'm Sarah, junior fullstack JS developer (with a preference for the back end, let's not lie 😬). 

### 🧐 About me

After 3 years of experience in **project management, UX / UI design and facilitation**, I started a reconversion thanks to O'clock coding school (https://oclock.io/).

I want to understand and control the entire chain of value of a website / web application: starting from the idea, prototyping, testing, develop and end up with a final version.

I just finished my training (700 hours from October 2020 to March 2021), and it has provided a base of technical skills, with a focus on JavaScript and
Node.js. I specialized in back-end (API / Data) for a month. In parallel, I have developed personal projects in order to learn, to practice, to evolve
constantly. 

I'm rigorously offbeat: creative, resourceful and meticulous at the same time.

I'm curious, patient, love debugging (really! and I genuinely love to help debugging, too!), and aim to code as clean as possible.
