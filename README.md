## Hi there 👋

🌱 I'm Sarah, confirmed fullstack JS / PHP developer 

### 🧐 About me

After 3 years of experience in **project management, UX / UI design and facilitation**, I started a reconversion thanks to O'clock coding school (https://oclock.io/).

I want to understand and control the entire chain of value of a website / web application: starting from the idea, prototyping, testing, develop and end up with a final version.

I finished my training (700 hours from October 2020 to March 2021), and it has provided a base of technical skills, with a focus on JavaScript and
Node.js. I specialized in back-end (API / Data) for a month. In parallel, I have developed personal projects in order to learn, to practice, to evolve
constantly. 

In September 2021 to May 2022, I worked as a fullstack developer in a development agency in Toulouse. To date, I have developed the front-end of an information website for professionals (Next.js in Typescript) and an API for a Flutter application (Node.js in Typescript).

In June 2022, I really needed to reconcile my commitments and values with my work, which is why I'm joining Vendredi's tech team as a Laravel php / Vue.js fullstack web developer.

I'm rigorously offbeat: creative, resourceful and meticulous at the same time.

I'm curious, patient, love debugging (really! and I genuinely love to help debugging, too!), and aim to code as clean as possible.
